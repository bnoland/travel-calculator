**[Theory of induced travel]{.underline}**

In evaluating whether or how much induced travel may occur it is
necessary to understand the underlying economic and behavioral impacts
that occur when additional road capacity is added to a network. Adding
more lanes to a road or extending an existing road will have immediate
effects on reducing travel time, or the cost of travel, and secondary
impacts of making more land accessible for development. Travel time
costs tend to be the major cost associated with vehicle travel and this
is associated with congestion levels. As such, any reduction in
congestion leads to faster traffic and reduced travel time costs. Basic
economic theory implies that a reduction in the cost of a good (in this
case vehicle travel time) leads to an increase in consumption.

This can be graphically explained by reference to the figure below. At
equilibrium the price or cost of travel is P1 and the quantity is Q1.
Any increase in road capacity, i.e., the supply of roads, shifts the
supply curve from S1 to S2, with a consequent reduction in price (cost)
of travel to P2 and increase in quantity traveled to Q2. In this
example, the induced travel effect has increased total travel and the
elasticity of demand (typically estimated in various models) is
positive. Additional exogenous growth in travel may still occur shifting
the demand curve to the right leading to a further increase in travel to
Q3, for example due to population growth. However, the growth in
population in itself may be endogenous as the added development induced
by additional road capacity may lead to population growth within a
region.

Not accounting for induced travel (or the demand response to price
reductions) assumes an inelastic vertical demand curve as shown in the
figure below. In this case, any added supply (the shift from S1 to S2)
leads to a reduction in price from P1 to P2, while the quantity of
travel remains the same, Q1=Q2. Any observed increase in congestion is
assumed to be strictly exogenous (determined by other factors) and is
represented by the shift in the demand curve to D2.

While simple economic theory can explain induced travel, the actual
behavioral impacts are more complex. For example, one of the first
things that is typically observed when capacity is increased is the
"return to the peak", that is the peak level of traffic congestion stays
the same as those who traveled at less preferred times of day shift back
to the peak. For example, a commuter who travels very early in the
morning (or late in the morning) to avoid the morning peak, now travels
at a more preferred time. This is beneficial to the commuter who sees a
benefit in traveling at their preferred time of day, but the morning
peak of congestion remains the same. This effect will also reduce
congestion levels during the "shoulder" of the peak period, potentially
allowing more travel to be induced at those times.

Other behavioral effects may be more dependent on the specific context
and geographic environment of any road expansion. These include shifts
from alternative routes to what is now a faster route. For example, some
travelers may have used a parallel arterial road that took about the
same time as the congested freeway. If the freeway is now faster,
travelers will shift to it and prior congestion levels will return.
Expanded capacity that reduces travel costs can also lead to both longer
trips and more trips.

Areas with good public transit systems, especially those that access
central areas, may see a shift from transit use to vehicle travel that
diminishes the travel time reductions that any capacity expansion may
initially provide. In most parts of the country, this effect is far less
pronounced than in the past given the low ridership levels on many
transit systems. The Downs-Thomson paradox (see [Arnott & Small,
1994](https://www.jstor.org/stable/29775281)) described this effect in
essence arguing that road capacity increases were self-defeating due to
shifts from transit; expansions in road capacity shifted transit users
to vehicles, leading to reduced transit service frequencies, which
further shifted transit users to driving until the transit system could
no longer justify providing service. Thus, in the end, congestion and
traffic levels on the expanded road are higher than before the capacity
addition.

Induced travel is often described as having a short-run and long-run
effect and corresponding short and long-run elasticities. There is no
standard time-frame as to what is considered short run as most of the
behavioral changes in travel patterns can occur quite quickly. Longer
run effects are usually associated with changes in land use and
development patterns.

Again, we can turn to standard economic theory to understand these
longer run impacts. Cities and regions have long been defined by how
accessible activities are between central areas and more distant areas.
As reductions in travel time increase, more distant land becomes more
accessible and available for development. In the 19^th^ century, the
commuter railroads spurred development outside the city, but this was
clustered within walking distance of the station. With the advent of
motor vehicles this more distant development was highly dependent on
cars. This was also due to reductions in travel costs and these
development impacts may account for a substantial share of induced
travel effects. Furthermore, while they are often defined as the "long
term" impacts, developers anticipate the opening of new capacity and
build long before that capacity is completed, thus the freeway may be
full on opening day!

Thus, the theoretical basis for induced travel is well established.
However, critics of induced travel typically argue that roads are built
and expanded based on forecasts of increased demand. That is, one should
expect roads to fill up after capacity is increased. As discussed in
empirical studies, it is established that capacity expansion will induce
more travel. Critics often argue over the definition of induced travel
and ignore the longer run consequences of how expanded roads affect
development patterns. To a large extent, these arguments boil down to
value judgements on preferred development patterns, whether areas should
be built to be more compact and walkable or more sprawling and
auto-dependent. The latter development pattern will have greater
environmental and climate impacts than the former.

**[Empirical evidence]{.underline}**

Previous studies have sought to estimate vehicle-travel elasticities
associated with changes in lane miles. The majority of these studies use
aggregate data on vehicle-miles of travel (VMT) and lane miles, for
example, at the state, county or MSA level. Much of this work extended
the seminal studies of [Hansen et al.
(1993)](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/6zz3k76c) and [Hansen & Huang
(1997)](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0965-8564(96)00019-5) who analyzed data
for California and all showed an association between lane-miles and VMT.
Critics claimed that the results of these studies did not demonstrate a
causal effect, that is, that growth in lane miles led to growth in
travel.

To address this issue, several studies tackled this problem
statistically with varying degrees of success. [Noland
(2001)](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0965-8564(99)00047-6) estimated
state-level elasticities using a lagged seemingly unrelated regression
for multiple road types while [Noland & Cowart
(2000)](https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1005288826997) estimated MSA-level
elasticities and attempted an instrumental variable model to control for
causality. [Fulton et al. (2000)](https://doi.org/10.21949/1506078)
estimated a sequential model that demonstrated a causal impact of
increasing lane miles using county-level data for three states. [Cervero
and Hansen (2002)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/20053915) and [Duranton
and Turner (2011)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/23045653) estimated
models using instrumental variables. [Hymel, Small, and Van Dender
(2010)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trb.2010.02.007) use state-level data
and control for simultaneous effects, that is, how vehicle travel itself
may affect the building of new capacity. [Rentziou, Gkritza &
Souleyrette (2012)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tra.2011.11.009) use a
different modeling approach and find similar effects. Most studies find
a much smaller elasticity estimate than [Duranton and Turner
(2011)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/23045653). The modeling in these
studies control for causal effects and demonstrate a linkage between
road expansion and increases in VMT. All have found statistically
significant impacts, but the elasticities generated are quite different.

[Cervero (2003)](https://doi.org/10.1080/01944360308976303) also
estimated a model using facility-specific data, in this case measuring
road capacity for selected projects rather than aggregate changes in
lane miles. Again, he found statistically significant results in this
case using a structured equation model, also known as a "path" model.
[Cervero (2003)](https://doi.org/10.1080/01944360308976303) found that
40% of VMT growth can be attributed to capacity improvement (the
remainder being due to other effects). This was substantially more than
[Noland's (2001)](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0965-8564(99)00047-6)
estimate that attributed 28% to capacity improvements. Surprisingly,
[Cervero (2003)](https://doi.org/10.1080/01944360308976303) interpreted
this as not being a large contributor to VMT growth, while Noland's
study was interpreted as showing capacity expansion was the major
influence. If anything, this shows how modeling results can easily be
misinterpreted and in all cases, these models controlled for other
factors that affect VMT growth.

At least three reviews of the induced travel literature have been done
over the last 25 years. [Noland & Lem
(2002)](https://doi.org/10.1016/S1361-9209(01)00009-8) summarized
existing work up through about 2002. [Noland & Hanson
(2013)](https://doi.org/10.5822/978-1-59726-242-2_5) also produced a
review that included work conducted in the 2010's including some
simulation and modeling studies and the influential work of [Duranton &
Turner (2011)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/23045653). These are
summarized in the table below. More recently, [Volker & Handy
(2022)](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/1hh9b9mf) published a review as
part of their development of the [California Induced Travel
Calculator](https://travelcalculator.ncst.ucdavis.edu/). These
elasticities in the table below show a range of short-term and long-term
elasticities and some variation between studies. [Duranton & Turner
(2011)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/23045653) produced the largest
elasticity values. Most research suggests that larger and generally more
congested roads (for example, interstate highways in urban areas) will
have larger elasticity values. These results are used in the calculator
as specified in the data section.

**[Data]{.underline}**

The calculator relies on data collected by the New Jersey Department of
Transportation and publicly available at:
<https://www.nj.gov/transportation/refdata/roadway/vmt.shtm>. We use the
files listed under "VMT by Functional Classification Distributed by
County" for each year in the calculator. These data are in pdf files and
were transferred to an Excel file for further processing.

The data provide estimates of road mileage and VMT by county for seven
functional classifications of roads in urban areas and an additional
seven for rural areas. We combined some of the road classifications to
minimize those instances in which there were zero road miles (for
example, many of the more urbanized counties had no roads classified as
rural or had minimal miles of roads under that category). A shortcoming
of New Jersey's data is that we do not have lane mileage data, only road
mileage (center-line miles). Based on a [pdf
file](https://rutgers.app.box.com/file/1365361429302) provided by NJDOT,
we applied conversion factors to the road mile data and as shown in the
table below. These represent average state-level one-directional lane
mileage for each functional classification.

Road classifications available in the data are listed in the table and
those that were combined are shown. For urban roads we combined
interstates with freeways/expressways as these both largely have
identical road designs, including being largely controlled access
highways. For urban roads we combined interstates with two additional
road types encompassing freeways and principal arterials. For both urban
and rural collector roads we combined major and minor collectors. In
total we have five urban road categories and four rural road categories
in the calculator. This was done for all [21 counties in New
Jersey](https://njac.org/new-jersey-counties/).

Our first year of data is 2017 and we will update to the latest year
available. Caution should be used when analyzing data and interpreting
results for 2020 and 2021 due to changes in travel patterns due to the
COVID pandemic.

Elasticity assumptions in the calculator are shown in the table for each
road classification. In general, the empirical evidence suggests that
larger higher speed roads have a larger elasticity. We have included a
range and the calculator output provides a range of estimates for
induced VMT. Given the potential range of estimates and variation in how
VMT may be affected, we have included a "back-calculator" which allows
the estimation of an "implied elasticity" based on forecast growth in
VMT associated with a capacity expansion.

**[[Calculations]{.underline}]{.mark}**

[The elasticities shown above are used to determine how a change in lane
miles will lead to a change in VMT. The formula for estimating the
induced VMT is:]{.mark}

$$Induced\_ VMT = \varepsilon \bullet \frac{NewLM}{LM} \bullet VMT$$

[Where: ε = elasticity]{.mark}

[ *NewLM* = the newly added lane mileage for the county]{.mark}

[ *LM* = the current lane mileage in the county]{.mark}

[ *VMT* = the current vehicle-miles of travel in the county]{.mark}

[ *Induced_VMT* = the vehicle miles of travel induced by the increase in
lane miles]{.mark}

[The back-calculation simply reverses this equation but requires the
user to input both "new lane miles" and the "forecasted increase in
VMT". The output is an implicit elasticity, that is, the elasticity that
is implied by the forecast increase in VMT.]{.mark}

[The formula is as follows:]{.mark}

$$\overline{\varepsilon} = \frac{{VMT}_{forecast}}{VMT} \bullet \frac{LM}{NewLM}$$

[Where:]{.mark} $\overline{\varepsilon}$ [= implied elasticity]{.mark}

[ *VMT~forecast~* = forecast of *VMT* provided by others]{.mark}

[ *VMT* = the current vehicle-miles of travel in the county]{.mark}

[ *NewLM* = the newly added lane mileage for the county]{.mark}

[ *LM* = the current lane mileage in the county]{.mark}

**[Interpretation of output]{.underline}**

Empirical research on induced travel has shown that there is a positive
effect, that is, when lane miles are increased, there is an increase in
VMT. As most of these studies are based on aggregate data (e.g.
state-level or county-level totals) one needs to consider how an
individual project may affect VMT. Specifically, what is the local
context and how might that lead to either smaller or larger actual
increases in VMT? For example, what type of land use is proximate to the
project location? What type of transit network exists? What alternate
routes are available for drivers? The outputs provided give a range of
estimates based on the best available information, however, the
localized details of any specific project should be considered as well.

The back-calculator provides a different way to think about the impacts
of a project. Local transportation planners may have conducted various
studies and come up with a forecast of what they think the growth in
VMT, due to the project, will be. In some cases, they may assert that it
will have no effect on inducing VMT. The back-calculator will allow
users to estimate an "implied elasticity", or in other words, the
elasticity implied by the VMT forecast. The user can then assess whether
this estimate is reasonable based on the empirical research and local
knowledge of the project.
